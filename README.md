# Gridfitter: EVE Online ship powergrid fitting tool
Copyright (c) 2017 Po Huit

This simple tool tries to find a collection of fittings that
will achieve a given powergrid for your ship's fit. You must
specify the starting powergrid and the maximum number of
slots of each of three types that you are willing to accept:
low slots not including Power Diagnostic System modules, rig
slots, and Power Diagnostic System modules.

The tool will shuffle through all possible fits and choose
the cheapest workable one. The prices are hardwired from
2017-12-30, so are likely to be pretty approximate going
forward.

To try Gridfitter, say "python3 gridfitter.py -h" and
examine the usage summary.

This tool is at an early stage of development. It could
stand a great deal of improvement.
